This repository contains the Rmarkdown and KnitR'd html/docx/PDF detailing my reanalysis of the raw data in Figure 2H of Caillaud _et al_. The analysis can be viewed online in the gh-pages branch of this repo at [http://danmaclean.github.io/stats_mcc/index.html]([http://danmaclean.github.io/stats_mcc/index.html)

The repository is organised as follows:

`raw/` - the Excel files as provided to me and some with manual cleaning up I had to do.
`data/` - reorganised data file for easier R.
`analysis.Rmd` - The executable R code of the analysis.
`analysis.[html|pdf|docx]` - The rendered, executed R code in various formats.
`figure.png` - a large pretty figure of the key plot in the analysis.
`index.html` - a renamed `analysis.html` that allows github.io to render it for easy browsing of the report.
